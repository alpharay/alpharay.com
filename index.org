* PROFILE
I was previously with the Wireless Intelligent Systems Lab. (WiSL) of Hanbat National University. My present research interests focus mainly on the optimization of algorithms which utilize simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning across various wireless networks. Previously, I have also investigated the use of AI and machine learning in signal processing and network security vulnerability detection i.e., the detection of man-in-the-middle attacks on mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs).
On the other end of the spectrum, I have recently started researching and working with blockchain infrastructure to actively develop smart contracts in Solidity, Python and JavaScript. My predominant interests range from digital finance (Defi) technologies and the frameworks that underline such systems to the general crypto-economy ecosystem.
