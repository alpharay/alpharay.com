* PROFILE
I am a currently a postdoctoral researcher with the Wireless Intelligent Systems Lab  (WiSL) of Hanbat National University.
My present research interests focus mainly on the optimization of algorithms that utilize simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT), artificial intelligence (AI)  and machine learning across various wireless networks
